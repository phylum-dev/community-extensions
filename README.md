# Community Extensions
A collection of community extensions for the Phylum toolkit. These extensions
expand Phylum's functionality even further than the [official extensions](https://github.com/phylum-dev/cli/tree/main/extensions).
Some of these may be on their way to becoming official extensions. We hope you
find them useful.

You can find the following extensions in the repository:

* [`build-gradle`](./build-gradle/README.md) - Parse `build.gradle` files for submission to Phylum
* [`multilock`](./multilock/README.md) - Submit multiple lockfiles to Phylum at once
* [`pip`](./pip/README.md) - Support for `pip` sandboxing and dependency analysis
* [`sbom`](./sbom/README.md) - Generate SBOMs from Phylum job submissions

# Contributions welcome
If you have written an extension that you think others would find useful,
please submit a PR!

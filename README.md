# Community Extensions

A collection of community extensions for the Phylum toolkit.
These extensions expand Phylum's functionality even further than the
[official extensions](https://github.com/phylum-dev/cli/tree/main/extensions).
Some of these may be on their way to becoming official extensions.
We hope you find them useful.

You can find the following extensions in the repository:

* [`sarif`](./sarif/README.md) - Generate SARIF from a Phylum project
* [`snyk-import`](./snyk-import/README.md) - Import projects from Snyk

## Contributions welcome

If you have written an extension that you think others would find useful,
please submit a PR!
